  * Dependencies: Digraph.java, DirectedCycle.java, BreadthFirstDirectedPaths,
  * Queue.java, StdOut.java, In.java
  *
  * Description: Takes in a digraph as input and finds the length of the shortest
  * ancestral path between two vertices, as well as the actual ancestor. Also checks
  * the digraph to see if it is a DAG or if it is a rootedDAG.
